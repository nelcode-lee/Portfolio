# Introduction

#### The Dataset used in this report provides a comprehensive view of Amazon’s last-mile logistics operation. It includes data on over 43,632 deliveries across multiple cities, with detailed information on order details, delivery agents, weather and traffic conditions, and delivery performance metrics. 

#### Our aim is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover insights and patterns that can help improve delivery efficiency and overall customer experience.  Last-mile delivery is the final step of the delivery process where a package is transported from a transportation hub to its destination. This stage is crucial as it directly impacts customer satisfaction and operational costs.
#### The insights gained from this analysis can be used to optimise supply chains, enhance agent performance, and ultimately provide a better experience for Amazon's customers.

# Findings

## Correlation:

### There are positive correlations between:

#### •	Delivery time and age of delivery agent (0.25)
#### •	Order hour and delivery time (0.17)
#### •	Pickup hour and delivery time (0.17)

## Stats:

#### •	The mean agent rating is 4.6.
#### •	The average age of a delivery agent is 30
#### •	The mean delivery time is 125 minutes
#### •	The mean delivery distance is 38 km

## Peak Times:

#### •	Peak order times are between 17:00 and 00:00
#### •	Peak collection times are between 18:00 and 00:00 

## Effects on delivery times:

#### •	Inclement weather can add between 20 -35 mins to a mean delivery time.
#### •	Traffic conditions ranging in density from medium to jam increase delivery times by between 20 - 46 mins.
#### •	Scooters and bicycles take the longest mean delivery time.
#### •	Semi Urban deliveries can double the delivery time of any other delivery area.



## Action Points:

#### Customer satisfaction can be improved if experienced delivery agents are trained and recruited.
#### Peak order times require peak staff levels to ensure efficient delivery.
#### Route optimisation will reduce lost time in heavy traffic conditions and ensure longer distance deliveries are applied to the most effective form of transport for delivery time reduction.
